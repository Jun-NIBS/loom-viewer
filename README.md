# Loom

Loom is a browser for working with large-scale single-cell RNA-seq datasets stored in `.loom` format. You can visualize the data using heatmaps, tSNE plots, PCA and sparklines. In the future, you may be able to run clustering and similar tools from inside Loom.

### Using Loom

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for **Python 2.7** (not 3.xx).
2. Download the latest Loom release and unzip it to a folder.
3. Get a dataset in .loom format (e.g. "cortex_5000.loom") in Dropbox under `Datasets`.
4. Run `loom cortex_5000.loom` in your Terminal.
5. Go to `localhost:5000` in your browser.
